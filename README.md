# X3sync
X3sync is a Python tool I developed to synchronize browser data—bookmarks, cookies, and passwords—across multiple browsers to a USB drive. Leveraging my knowledge and AI assistance, it supports Brave, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, ensuring your essential data is always backed up and easily accessible.
